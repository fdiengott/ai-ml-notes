Two agents via self play on a zero sum debate game have a debate which is judged by human judges which agent gave the most true useful information

1. A question q ∈ Q is shown to both agents. 
2. The two agents state their answers $a_0, a_1 ∈ A$ (which may be the same). 
3. The two agents take turns making statements $s_0, s_1, . . . , s_{n−1} ∈ S$. 
4. The judge sees the debate $(q, a, s)$ and decides which agent wins. 
5. The game is zero sum: each agent maximizes their probability of winning.
