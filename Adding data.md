Instead of adding data of all kinds, you should focus on adding more data of the types where analysis shows it should help

## Data augmentation
Creating more data from existing data

### For images
taking an existing example and creating new examples by rotating, changing the size of the original, changing the contrast, distorting/warping it 

### For audio
adding background noise (of different kinds)
lowering the quality as if on a bad connection

## Data synthesis
creating new training examples from scratch (mostly used for computer vision tasks)
