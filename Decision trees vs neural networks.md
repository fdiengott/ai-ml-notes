[[Decision Trees]] vs [[Neural Networks]], when to use which?

## Decision trees
- Works well when the data is quite structured, or tabular
- fast to train
- small decision trees may be human interpretable
- XGBoost is the most common to use
## Neural networks
- Works well when the data that is unstructured (images, audio, text), as well as structured (tabular) data
- may be slower
- works with transfer learning
- when building a system of multiple models working together, it might be easier to connect multiple neural networks together
