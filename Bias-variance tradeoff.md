>Bias
>the amount of error introduced into a simplified model when introduced to real-world phenomena

> Variance
> How much the test error changes based upon variation in the training data
> In other words, a model's sensitivity to the idiosyncrasies of the training data

As a model increases in complexity, it's bias decreases but it's variance increases. Too much bias, [[Underfitting|underfit]], too much variance, [[Overfitting|overfit]].
