# AI Notes

This is a repo I am going to update as I work through the [AI Safety Fundamentals Course](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) created by BlueDot Impact.

It will include notes, a list of articles to read, or have read, other material such as videos, and potentially podcast episodes. I will likely, eventually add a list of projects I will have work on in the AI Safety landscape. Lastly, I might end up writing some musings on AI and AI Safety that I'm confident will be of no interest to anyone but me, however, it is a great way to track how my own thinking in real-time and see how it is changing as I learn more.
