# How to read a research paper

5-20 papers --- a basic understanding of an area
50-100 papers --- a deep understanding of the concepts

## Steps
1. Read the title, abstract, and figures.
2. Read the Intro, conclusion, figures, and skim the rest (skip related work)
3. Read all of it, but skip the math.
4. Read all of it, but skip the parts that don't make sense.


## Internal Questions
- Goals --- What did the authors try to accomplish?
- Takeaways --- What were the key elements of the approach?
- Self implementation --- What can you use yourself?
- Future --- What other references do you want to follow?
