Instead of having one feature take on more than 2 values, split the values into their own features where values can either be 1 or 0

Can be used for [[Decision Trees]] or [[Neural Networks]] as well as linear or logistic regressions

## Example
In this example, the ear shape feature previously took on 3 values. After changing to one-hot encoding, each option is its own feature that can be either 0 or 1
