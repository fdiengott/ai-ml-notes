## Terms

- [[Convolutional Neural Network]] (CNN)
	- Good for analyzing images

- [[Overfitting]]
  One reason for a model not generalizing on the training data could be it is overfit, where a model learns the training data too well to the point where it captures noise instead of the underlying patterns.

- scalar/tensor/vector/matrix
  - scalar: a single number
  - vector: an array of numbers. a 1d matrix
  - matrix: a 2d array of numbers
  - tensor: a list of data that can have any number of dimensions
